README.Eclipse

If you use the Eclipse IDE, you will find the following helpful:

1) There are now three main Projects:
	JavaCookJars - the .jar files you need to compile
	darwinsys-api - the com.darwinsys packages (includes a lot of the
		examples form the book which are in here rather than in the
		per-chapter subdirectories!)
	javasrc - the main collection, mostly per-chapter.

2) Let me know what breaks :-)

Thanks, and best wishes.

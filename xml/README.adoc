= javasrc/xml

This contains various XML demos.

The JDOM demos have been commented out and/or turned from .java to .txt files.
This is because the JDOM project has known about a security glitch for over six
months and not released a security-patched version in all that time,
citing problems of only one developer having the credentials and he being
too busy with $DAYJOB to get around to testing and deploying the fixed version.
Sorry, guys. JDom examples will be purged if this isn't resolved soonish.

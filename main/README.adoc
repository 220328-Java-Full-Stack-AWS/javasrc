This is the largest section of Ian's JavaSrc project, holding all
the files that don't fit into any of the more specific categories.

== Random Histogram Plots

If you're here for the Random Number stuff, you can try one of these:

* Use Apache Maven to build, then run `java numbers.Random4` with a classpath, then run R with a redirection;
* Use the Unix shell script scripts/run-random-histo, which combines all the previous steps;
* Open this `main` folder as an IDE project in e.g., IntelliJ, and run Random5, which uses the JVM-based
https://renjin.org[renjin] "R Engine" for a unified script.

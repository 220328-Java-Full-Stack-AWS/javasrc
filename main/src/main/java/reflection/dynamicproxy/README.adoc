= Reflection.dynamicproxy

There are three "main program" demos here:

. ManualProxy - creates the proxy "by hand"

. DynamicProxyDemo - uses the JavaSE dynamic proxy mechanism

. DynamicProxyFactory - similar but with explicit use of factory pattern

Other stuff here:

* QuoteServer - the interface exposed by the server (and its proxies);
* QuoteServerImpl - what it says on the tin
* InvocationHandler - the tie-in with the dynamic proxy mechanism

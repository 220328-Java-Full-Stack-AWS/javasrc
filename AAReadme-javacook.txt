This is Ian Darwin's Collected Java Source Examples. It includes
everything used as example code in my O'Reilly publication The Java Cookbook.
The files are organized roughly one directory per chapter, as follows:

starting	Chapter 1, Getting Started
environ		Chapter 2, Environment
strings		Chapter 3, Strings
RE			Chapter 4, Regular Expressions
numbers		Chapter 5, Numbers
datetime	Chapter 6, Dates and Times
structure	Chapter 7, Data Structuring
oop			Chapter 8, Object Oriented Techniques
io			Chapter 9, Input and Output
javax.comm	Chapter X, Serial Communications
dir_file	Chapter 11, Directory and File
network		Chapter ?? and ??, Networking Clients and Servers
graphics	Chapter ??, Graphics

Within each directory, the filenames are pretty much the same as
the class file names used in the text.

See the file License.txt for copying rules; it's basically the
original Berkeley free software (or "open-source") copyright.

= javasrc/testing

This module of https://github.com/Iandarwin/javasrc[Ian's Javasrc Repo]
contains just the examples related to testing
with https://JUnit.org/[JUnit] and friends.

You can download this from
https://github.com/IanDarwin/javasrc[].
You can then open either the testing project
or the whole mess; it's mostly more convenient
to open just the project you need at a time.

<H1>The bsd.comm Driver for javax.comm</H1>
<P>The core <A HREF="http://java.sun.com">Java APIs</A> do not 
allow you to read/write serial/parallel/etc. ports,
because only on UNIX and <A HREF="http://www.openbsd.org/">
UNIX-like systems</A> do such things have entries in the
filesystem namespace. The UNIX "device special file" is a great idea,
and it's too bad MacOS and that thing from Bill Gates never adopted it.
But they didn't, and now it's too late.
<P>To the rescue comes <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/javacomm">
The Java Communications API</A>.
However, the <I>javax.comm</I> package, as it's known, does not provide
direct support for platforms other than Solaris and Win32.
As you might expect, the code for dealing with baud rates, parity
settings, etc., is rather platform-specific. However, there is
no great difficulty in controlling the terminal on BSD-derived systems,
and writing a bit of "native code" to handle this is pretty easy.
I've made a start on it, and here it is. This source is for
the <A HREF="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD flavor</A>, but should
compile without much change on the other BSD platforms.

<P><B>Linux users:</B> please don't bother porting this to Linux.
First, it's covered by the 
<A HREF="license.txt">Berkeley Copyright</A>, which is imiscible
with the GPL. This is a feature. Secondly, somebody's 
<A HREF="http://www.interstice.com/kevinh/linuxcomm.html">
already done a Linux version</A>.

<P>The core Java APIs do not allow you to read/write serial/parallel/etc
ports, because only on UNIX and <A HREF="http://www.openbsd.org/"
UNIX-like systems</A> do such things have entries in the
filesystem namespace. The UNIX "device special file" is a great idea,
and it's too bad MacOS and that thing from Bill Gates never adopted it.
But they didn't, and now it's too late.
<P>To the rescue comes <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/comm">
The Java Communications API</A>.
However, the <I>javax.comm</I> package, as it's known, does not provide
direct support for platforms other than Solaris and Win32.
As you might expect, the code for dealing with badu rates, parity
settings, etc., is rather platform-specific. However, there is
no great difficulty in controlling the terminal on BSD-derived systems,
and writing a bit of "native code" to handle this is pretty easy.
I've made a start on it, and here it is. This source is for
the <A HREF="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD flavor, but should
compile without much change on the other BSD platforms.

<P><B>Linux users:</B> please don't bother porting this to Linux.
First, it's covered by the

with the GPL. This is a feature. Secondly, somebody's

already done a Linux version</A>.

<h1>XML Examples</h1>
This directory contains most of my the collected XML examples.
<p>
Most of what's here is published in my
Java Cookbook.
<p>
If you have files here named Accessor*.java, 
they are extracted from my JabberPoint
slide show program.
These show an application actually reading
XML and building program data structures
from XML, using both DOM and JDOM.
If you don't have these examples,
you can download them from the JabberPoint section
of my web site (www.darwinsys.com).

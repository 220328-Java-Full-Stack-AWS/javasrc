<P>This is a program we use in setting up the machines for 471/478.
The main GUI uses the Swing Set and a few native AWT components.
It is written using a fairly simple Model-View-Controller paradigm.
<P>Nothing too portable here; most of this code is highly Win-95 specific,
and the program is dependant on Learning Tree Course Setup
machine names, network numbers, etc.
The back-end runs the Win95 RegEdit utility directly with a 
regedit .REG datafile that we write, and even tries to reboot
the computer afterward using native code (reboot.c) based on the
famous "Exploder" program.

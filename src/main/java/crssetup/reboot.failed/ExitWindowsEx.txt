// ExitWindowsEx flags
//	EWX_FORCE	Forces processes to terminate. Instead of bringing up
//		the "application not responding" dialog box for the user, this 
//		value forces an application to terminate if it does not respond.
//	EWX_LOGOFF	Shuts down all processes running in the security context
//		of the process that called the ExitWindowsEx function. Then it 
//		logs the user off.
//	EWX_POWEROFF	Shuts down the system and turns off the power. The
//		application must have the SE_SHUTDOWN_NAME privilege (for more 
//		information, see the Remarks section) and the system must support
//		the power-off feature.
//	EWX_REBOOT	Shuts down the system and then restarts the system.
//		The application must have the SE_SHUTDOWN_NAME privilege.
//	EWX_SHUTDOWN	Shuts down the system to a point at which it is safe
//		to turn off the power. All file buffers have been flushed to disk,
//		and all processes have stopped. The application must have 
//		the SE_SHUTDOWN_NAME privilege.

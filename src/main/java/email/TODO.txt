Things you might do to improve MailClient:
	Extract the GUI code in MailComposeBean into its own class, and use
		it in MailReaderBean instead of all those calls to TextArea.add();
	Move MailReaderBean loading code into a method, so we can load a new mbox.
	MailReaderBean needs a Reply button (implement addActionListener)
	MailReaderBean - handle HTML mail - use DataHandler.
	Menus.
	Options:
		Aliases for composing.
		Various reply options (Reply to sender, reply to all, etc.)
		Compose/Reply Templates.

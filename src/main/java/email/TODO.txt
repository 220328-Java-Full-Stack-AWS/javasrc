Things you might do to improve MailClient:
  MailComposeBean
	Extract the GUI code in MailComposeBean into its own class, and use
		it in MailReaderBean instead of all those calls to TextArea.add();
		-- Also add Reload button, using same code.
		-- Add FolderNotificationListener to replace button!
	Do the sending in a new Thread, so you don't lock up the GUI.
  MailReaderBean
	Move MailReaderBean loading code into a method, so we can load a new mbox.
	MailReaderBean needs a Reply button (implement addActionListener)
	MailReaderBean - handle HTML mail - use DataHandler.
  General:
	Menus!!
	Options:
		Aliases in outgoing mail (done in JabaDex).
		Various reply options (Reply to sender, reply to all, etc.)
		Compose/Reply Templates.
	GUI to set things like protocol, hostname, etc. (done in JabaDex).

<title>Cart Bean?</title>
<h1>Cart Bean?</h1>
<p>This is not a fully-working cart bean, just a few scratchings.
Should a Cart be implemented as:
<ul>
<li>A servlet? Light weight, not persistent
<li>A stateful session bean? Moderate weight, maybe more scaleable
<li>An entity bean? Heavy weight, but persistent!
</ul>
The point is, you have to decide what is the best way to implement
your cart, based on such factors as the cost of items you sell,
the volume of your site, and so on.
</p>
<p>At any rate, here are some starting points for the stateful session
version:
<ul>
<li><a href="CartHome.java">CartHome.java</a>, the home interface</li>
<li><a href="Cart.java">Cart.java</a>, the remote interface</li>
<li><a href="CartBean.java">CartBean.java</a>, the bean implementation</li>
</ul>

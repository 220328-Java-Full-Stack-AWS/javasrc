Using Interfaces to enforce method correctness in EJBs

* Bean cannot implement the Remote interface (due to RemoteException)
* However classes can implement more than one interface
	- can not add exceptions when implementing.
	- not required to have all throwses.

SO: WRite a standalone interface listing the methods, WITH RemoteException

.so MyMethods.java

In the Remote interface, EXTEND this interface

.so Remote.java

In the Bean Implementation, IMPLEMENT the interface

.so Bean.java

Using Interfaces to enforce remote method correctness in EJBs
	by Ian F. Darwin, ian@darwinsys.com

* Bean cannot implement the Remote interface (due to RemoteException)
* However classes can implement more than one interface
	- can not add exceptions when implementing.
	- NOT required to have all throws clauses.

SO: Write a standalone interface listing the remote methods WITH RemoteException

.so MyMethods.java

Interfaces can extend MORE THAN ONE superinterface(!).
	Obvious in hindsight, since a class can implement more than one interface.

In the Remote interface, EXTEND this interface (in add'n to EJBObject!)

.so Remote.java

In the Bean Implementation, IMPLEMENT the interface

.so Bean.java

Presto! Compiler will ensure agreement between bean and remote.

Can NOT do this for the home interface due to method name changes.
